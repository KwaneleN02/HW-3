I think here experience called for me. Pretty sure if I had taken the class I should've taken, this would be a walk in a park. For whatever reason, it wasn't. And I struggled. Hard. But I wanted to be independent. And it's a good thing that I struggled. Because this is how I learn. But I failed here. 

Some elements make sense, but here is a highlight of my struggles: 

When to put what element. This is probabaly my top mistake with all my assignments. Sometimes I write the correct block, but place it in a wrong spot. And this is why I say that had I taken Creative Coding, this would probably be not a problem. Who knows? 
I understand why a code block is there. I guess this is the easiest thing for me. Reading code. After reading, I have a harder time applying it. I don't know if this is just a special issue, but that's another major of my issue. And it was more true to this assignment than anything else.
