The good: 
As an aspiring web dev. It's exciting to see the growth from the first website to the final piece. The good part is really thinking creatively and think about different ways to incorporate different elements within a site. The important things and doing a lot, and a lot of research on each phase of this project. Needless to say, taking this class taught me to think creatively in ways I never thought I could. Okay, less blabbing... Animations!!! YESS! I can animate elements in a website. It's not working the way I would like, but hey, I have animation. 

I did one API research on how to add the google maps on a website in my contact page!!! This is awesome!!!! 

The bad: 
This is not the bad, but more of a struggle. My slideshow is not covering the body of my website, causing a slight glitch in my design. I can probably get away with it, but if an employer or client did not want to see that in their site, I'd be in trouble! I'd still like to know what to do to resolve. 
My animation works. Yes, but it's not working properly. For instance, in my contact page, my elements are suppose to fade in nicely. Actually, Haha! As I was typing this I realized what I was doing wrong. So it's fixed now. Haha! Anything else? Ah, yes, working on layouts. 
I am realizing that layouts are extremely importatnt in web development. I don't have any layout in this site. Just elements thrown in together.
