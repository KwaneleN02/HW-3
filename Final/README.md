The good: 
I am slowly getting a hang of this. I really think I accomplished gold with my header and the images transitioning. I think this was the best part of my project. 

The bad: 

So, some of my images are not transitioning correctly. I don't know what I needed to do there. Oh well. 
In my image animation for my body, I kind of struggled with having my images slide in with the boxes. That's what I wanted to accomplish. I failed at that miserably, so I compromized. 
I would still like to do something like it again just so I can get a hang of it.
