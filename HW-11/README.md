Stuggles for this assignment: 
Alright! I don't know. I did okay. I am obviously not impressed with how things turned out. They could've been better. I really struggled with getting collisions. And I still don't understand how they work. Chances are, I probably will not even try to use them professionally. Or a canvas for that matter. I am realizing that this was my toughest time in this class. I think a canvas has a lot to offer, but I believe it'll take me a long time to figure this one out. 

The last couple of weeks had me question my ability to work professionally as web developer. I am not sure if I can actually accomplish that. 

The good news is....

I figured some things out. I feel comfortable parsing json now. I feel comfortable with Arrays and I definitely feel like I understand a lot of good elements in JavaScript. HTML 5 will take some time for me to get used to.
