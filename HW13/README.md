I think that there is a lot of potential for three.js. I see how there is very minimal tutorials on it though. It seems clunky and unhandled well. 
I don't think I had a hard time at all understanding three.js. I had a hard time incorporating a 3D object into the mixture and for whatever reason
Any code I tried was just not working regardless of the library I was using. I even copied and pasted the script from this week's homework. 
Nothing! The best case scenario was just a solid blank screen. I have seen a few nice sites with three.js and they're attractive!! It is definitely in my interest to further my learning with it.
