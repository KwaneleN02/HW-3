The good: 

Alright, so it is 5:30 AM. You would think someone would not be glad about waking up at 4:30 AM to deal with programming a website because they just don't understand what went wrong. Well, in my case, I am just happy. As happy as anyone can be with their projects. My website is working. So, let's talk about for a sec shall we? 

So, the landing page is welcoming you with a nice transitioning slideshow I did a while back for one of my homeworks. Well, that came back. I had some glitches then, but this time, it seems a lot more pleasant to watch. I have a Hamburger Nav on there because I really don't like the look of a website without a hamburger menu, it should not be a thing. Thanks to W3 schools as a reference for the Nav. 

Services page. Ah, my pride and joy really started here. A nice animated elements sliding down and the underline (underline "Services"), yes, that one, it also slides down. Hard to see, but let's not go crazy with it. Hover over my boxes when you get a chance. :) 

Contacts page. My joy! Yes! We have a nice fadeIn of elements on page load, thanks to JQuery! I used it, and I used it really good. 
I researched how to incorporate the googlemaps API in for my Contacts page. Although it is well executed, it doesn't load correctly, because Google wants me to pay 
for it, and I am student, so that's just not happening. But it's there. :) 

Overall, two weeks of hard work on this and I am happy with how it turned out. And it also encourages me to spend a good summer programming a bunch of made up websites until I get it right! 

The bad: 

This is not so much as the bad, but more of the hardship. I designed about three different styles. And I was failing to grasp my mind around animating. Again! Ugh. I am a failure. But wait... Two weeks later, LIGHT BULB, went back and tried one simple line and BOOM! It worked. Yup, it did. But the struggle. There is just one layout I would have loved to incorporate into this. But meh, we're good. 

Directory: 
Well, let's talk about this for a sec, I love having the ability to use Live Server, but it I found out (last minute) that it isn't all that reliable. Although my 
file reference was recognized in the Live Server, it was not in the actually dom, and github could not find any of my stylesheets nore any of my .js files and some images. The struggle! Thanks for bringing this issue up, because I was about to destroy the site again.... NOT!
