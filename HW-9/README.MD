The Good: 
My code works! I am starting to understand how this whole thing comes together.... I think. For now, let's just pretend I do. 
The nicest thing that I am seeing is help troubleshoot other's work. I still don't know if it's good advise I'm providing. But I think there is some understanding there. 


The Ugly! 
How many times do I have to break the code until it decides to work??? 
The nice thing about this is getting that aha moment. 
My code worked from the beginning. However, I ran into issues displaying the information onto a table. 
Pulling my JSON returned with undefined values and I had no idea why. Also, it was returning just 1 array instead of all. 
The reason for this was that I didn't use a for loop, which brought in all my values. Also, my values were undefined because of not defining each object. 
Insanity. 

The struggle?
Creating an API.... I don't even know where to start with this.
